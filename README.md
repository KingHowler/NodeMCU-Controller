You can view a demo of the NodeMCU's output over [here](https://kinghowler.github.io/NodeMCU-Controller/)

Note that the indicators on the demo do not change when clicked upon, this is because the code to change indicators must be run on the NodeMCU where there must be a separate bool to store the current state for each.
